marker. These can be changed with the **-p** (Printf) and **-r** (Record Marker) option
flags.

* **-1..-9** - file id
* **-a** | **-c** - append to / create file
* **-f** - file to write data
* **-p** - printf format string for writing data
* **-r** - record marker to write after data, defaults to newline

```

### Yes (man libui.sh) - Check if in Yes (-XY) mode.

Returns 0 if the "-XY" or "-Xy" (Yes) option flag was provided on the command
line, otherwise it returns 1. The **-e** (Enable) and the **-E** (Disable) option
flags can be used to enable and disable the Yes mode within the script.

## Variables

The libui library defines the following variables for use in scripts. Please
note that, while most are all caps, they are not environment variables.

* **${AA}** - Associative Array: Set to "true" if the shell supports associative arrays.
* **${AO}** - (Pq as in A O, not A zero) Array Offset: Set to "1" (one) if the shell is Z shell (zsh) and "0" (zero) otherwise.
* **${ANSWER}** - The last answer provided by the user via an Ask command.
* **${IWD}** - The path of the directory where the script was initially executed.
* **${BV}** - Bash Version: Set to the major and minor version of the Bash shell (without the
intervening period). Note: If the executing shell is the Z shell, BV will be set to "0" (zero).
* **${CHFLAGS}** - Chain flags: This variable collects command line flags (options) that should be passed on to chained scripts. (Chained scripts are scripts executed by the main script.) To properly use ${CHFLAGS}, place it as if it were a command line option for the script to be executed (e.g.: script ${CHFLAGS}). By default, the -XC, -XF, -XN, -XQ, and -XY options are automatically captured. Additional flags can be added as needed using the -C (Chain) option flag with AddOption.
* **${CMD}** - The command name, i.e., the filename of the main script.
* **${CMDARGS}** - An array containing the arguments provided on the command line.
* **${CMDLINE}** - The full command line string used to call the current script. This is the same as: ${CMD} "${CMDARGS[@]}"
* **${CMDPATH}** - The absolute path of the main script file.
* **${DOMAIN}** - The domain of the current machine.
* **${FMFLAGS}** - File management flags: For use by cp, mv, rm. Note: ${FMFLAGS} is set to "-i" by -C (Confirm) and to "-f" by-F (Force) options.
* **${GROUP}** - The primary group of the user.
* **${HEIGHT}** - Terminal window height in rows.
* **${HOST}** - The hostname of the current machine (hostname only, not fully qualified).
* **${LIBUI}** - The absolute path of the included libui.sh source file.
* **${MAXCOL}** - Maximum terminal window column. Equivalent to WIDTH - 1. Note: Terminal columns start at 0.
* **${MAXINT}** - Maximum integer: Set to the shell's maximum integer value.
* **${MAXROW}** - Maximum terminal window row. Equivalent to HEIGHT - 1. Note: Terminal rows start at 0.
* **${N}** - The newline character. This is equivalent to $'\n' but, available for use in string assignments.
* **${NROPT}** - The number of options provided on the command line.
* **${NRPARAM}** - The number of parameters provided on the command line.
* **${OS}** - The name of the operating system. Typical values are Darwin, Linux, SunOS, Solaris, etc.
* **${SHENV}** - The path of the currently executing shell (limited to: zsh, bash, or sh).
* **${TERMINAL}** - Set to "true" if standard out is to a terminal, "false" if standard out is not to a terminal. When standard out is to a terminal, the libui library generates color text and additional user cues including questions, etc. Note: The ${TERMINAL} variable  can be set to "true" or "false" before executing the script (or sourcing libui.sh) to force enabling / disabling these terminal effects. Note: The ${TERMINAL} variable is only set during initialization and should not be used to determine if output is actually to a terminal. Use the [[ -t 1 ]] construct to determine if STDOUT is actually to a terminal.
* **${UICMD}** - An array containing the names of (available) libui commands (including libui mod provided commands).
* **${UIMOD}** - An array containing the filenames of loaded libui mods.
* **${UIVERSION}** - An array containing the filenames and versions of the loaded scripts and libui mods in alternating "pairs": \<file\> \<version\> ...
* **${UNIX}** - The type of the operating system. The possible values are BSD, SYSV, or GNU (e.g. Linux).
* **${WIDTH}** - Terminal window width in colums.
* **${ZSH}** - Z shell - Set to "true" if the shell is Z shell (zsh).

## Vim Note

When using the ```#!/usr/bin/env libui``` shebang, syntax highlighting and
formatting can be improved by creating a ```~/.vim/ftdetect/libui.vim``` file
and adding the following to set the filetype to zsh (or bash):

```
autocmd BufRead *
            \ if getline(1) =~ '^#!/usr/bin/env libui' |
            \   set filetype=zsh |
            \ endif
```

If you prefer Bash syntax highlighting, change ```set filetype=zsh``` in the
file to ```set filetype=bash```.
