.Sh NAME
.Nm libuiSpinner.sh
.Nd Spinner Utilities Mod for the
.Xr libui.sh 3
user interface library
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Sy LoadMod Spinner
.Pp
.Sy StartSpinner
.Pp
.Sy PauseSpinner
.Pp
.Sy ResumeSpinner
.Pp
.Sy StopSpinner
.Pp
.Sy WaitSpinner
.Pp
.Sy Sleep

.Op Fl u Ar <interval>
.Op Ar <sleep>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
.Xr libui.sh 3
mod provides commands for displaying a progress spinner.
The
.Sx StartSpinner
and
.Sx StopSpinner
commands are used to wrap a section of (silent) code with a spinner.
The
.Sx WaitSpinner
commands is used to put a command in the background and display a spinner until
it completes.
The
.Sx PauseSpinner
and
.Sx ResumeSpinner
commands can be used within an action or within code being executed to pause and
resume an active spinner.
.Pp
The
.Nm
.Xr libui.sh 3
mod provides the following commands:
.Ss StartSpinner
The following command starts a visual spinner on stderr in the background.
.Bd -ragged -offset 4n
.Sy StartSpinner
.Ed
.Pp
Starts a background subshell that displays a spinner on stderr and captures the
background process ID ($!) for the
.Sx StopSpinner
command.
.Pp
Note: The
.Sx StartSpinner
and
.Sx StopSpinner
commands can only work with one spinner at a time.
If
.Sx StartSpinner
is called twice,
.Sx StopSpinner
will only be able to stop the last spinner
This can result in a spinner still being displayed (even after the script ends).
Also, because the system uses background processes and process management, it is
possible to start and stop a spinner too quickly leaving a running spinner in
the background.
.Ss PauseSpinner
The following command pauses an active spinner.
.Bd -ragged -offset 4n
.Sy PauseSpinner
.Ed
.Pp
Pauses an active spinner.
This is mostly used to pause a spinner while waiting for input from the user.
See the
.Sx ResumeSpinner
command for information on how to resume the paused spinner.
.Ss ResumeSpinner
The following command resumes a paused spinner.
.Bd -ragged -offset 4n
.Sy ResumeSpinner
.Ed
.Pp
Resumes a paused spinner.
This is mostly used to resume a spinner after waiting for input from the user.
See the
.Sx PauseSpinner
command for information on how to pause an active spinner.
.Ss StopSpinner
The following command stops the last visual spinner started in the background by
the
.Sx StartSpinner
command.
.Bd -ragged -offset 4n
.Sy StopSpinner
.Ed
.Pp
Stops the last background subshell started by the
.Sx StartSpinner
command to display a spinner.
It uses the background process ID captured by the
.Sx StartSpinner
command.
.Pp
Note: The
.Sx StartSpinner
and
.Sx StopSpinner
commands can only work with one spinner at a time.
If
.Sx StartSpinner
is called twice,
.Sx StopSpinner
will only be able to stop the last spinner
This can result in a spinner still being displayed (even after the script ends).
Also, because the system uses background processes and process management, it is
possible to start and stop a spinner too quickly leaving a running spinner in
the background.
.Ss WaitSpinner
The following command provides a visual spinner while the last background
command executes:
.Bd -ragged -offset 4n
.Sy WaitSpinner
.Ed
.Pp
Display a foreground spinner on stderr until the last executed background
process ($!) exits.
.Ss Sleep
The following command displays a countdown message while waiting for time to
pass:
.Bd -ragged -offset 4n
.Sy Sleep
.Op Fl i Ar "<message>"
.Op Fl u Ar <interval>
.Op Ar <sleep>
.Ed
The command options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -offset 4n -width 4n
.It Fl i Ar "<message>"
Use the
.Ar "<message>"
text to display the countdown message.
The provided
.Ar "<message>"
should include one "%s" to mark where the countdown value (seconds remaining)
should be placed.
The default message if the
.Fl i
(Info Message) option is not provided is: "Waiting %s...".
.It Fl u Ar <interval>
The number of seconds to sleep between updates to the message.
The default is one second if an
Ar <interval>
is not provided.
.It Ar <sleep>
The number of seconds to sleep.
The default is one second.
Note: The total number of seconds that the
.Sx Sleep
command will sleep is the
.Ar <sleep>
seconds
divided by the
.Ar <interval>
seconds rounded up to the
.Ar <interval>
seconds.
For example, using "Sleep -u 5 6" will result in a 10-second sleep.
.El
.Pp
Display a countdown message while waiting for time to elapse (i.e., sleeping).
.Sh VARIABLES
The
.Nm
.Xr libui.sh 3
mod
only generates spinner output on stderr if stdout is to a terminal.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Some examples include:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
.Sy StartSpinner
list=$(find .)
.Sy StopSpinner

Result: Starts a spinner in the background, performs the find, and stops the
spinner.
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
tar xf tarball.tar &

with a countdown to 0.
