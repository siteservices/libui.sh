.Sh NAME
.Nm libuiFileRecord.sh
.Nd Record CSV data Mod for the
.Xr libui.sh 3
user interface library
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Sy LoadMod Record
.Pp
.Sy RecordClose Op Ar <fileid> Op Ar <file_path>
.Pp
.Sy RecordEntry Op Fl d
.Pp
.Sy RecordOpen Op Ar <fileid> Ar <file_path>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
.Xr libui.sh 3
mod provides functions for opening, closing, and writing CSV data files.
The CSV format is defined using an array variable and the data to be written is
defined using an associative array variable.
The mod provides the global
vairables
.Sx RecordColumns
and
.Sx RecordData ,
however, any array and associative array variables may be used.
.Pp
The
.Nm
.Xr libui.sh 3
mod provides the following commands:
.Ss RecordClose
The following command unlocks and closes a file and disassociates the file ID
associated with the file path by the
.Sx RecordOpen
command:
.Bd -ragged -offset 4n
.Sy RecordClose
.Op Fl 1 Fl 2 Fl 3 Fl 4 Fl 5 Fl 6 Fl 7 Fl 8 Fl 9
.Op Ar <file_path>
.Ed
.Pp
The command options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -offset 4n -width 4n
.It Fl 1 Fl 2 Fl 3 Fl 4 Fl 5 Fl 6 Fl 7 Fl 8 Fl 9
The numeric options
.Fl 1
through
.Fl 9
provide a shorthand to associate a file ID with a file path.
.El
.Pp
Unlocks and disassociates the
.Ar <file_path>
associated with a file ID by the
.Sx RecordOpen
command.
See the
.Sx RecordOpen
command for more information.
.Pp
The
.Sy RecordClose
command works with either a numeric file ID option or a
.Ar <file_path> .
.Pp
Note: The
.Sy RecordClose
command passes parameters to and uses the
.Xr libui.sh 3
.Sy Close
command.
See the
.Sy Close
command in the
.Xr libui.sh 3
man page for more information.
The
.Sy Close
command is executed (with no parameters) during exit to close / unlock all open
files.
.Ss RecordEntry
The following command writes a CSV entry into a file associated with a file ID:
.Bd -ragged -offset 4n
.Sy RecordEntry
.Op Fl 1 Fl 2 Fl 3 Fl 4 Fl 5 Fl 6 Fl 7 Fl 8 Fl 9
.Op Ar <data_associative_array_name> <column_array_name>
.Ed
.Pp
The command options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -offset 4n -width 4n
.It Fl 1 Fl 2 Fl 3 Fl 4 Fl 5 Fl 6 Fl 7 Fl 8 Fl 9
The numeric options
.Fl 1
through
.Fl 9
provide a shorthand to access the file paths associated with a file ID by the
.Sx Open
command.
See the
.Sx RecordOpen
command for more information.
.El
.Pp
Writes the provided
.Ar <data>
to the file associated with a file ID by the
.Sx RecordOpen
command.
The default operation is to write the
.Sx RecordData
associative array data in the
.Sx RecordColumns
array column order to the file associated with file ID 1.
.Pp
The
.Sy RecordEntry
command creates a comma delimited data record (in RFC 4180 format) using the
data in either the passed
.Ar <data_associative_array_name>
associative array or the
.Sx RecordData
associative array variable.
The comma delimited data is ordered using the column order provided in the
passed
.Ar <column_array_name>
array or the
.Sx RecordColumns
array variable.
During processing, the
.Sy RecordEntry
command copies any parameter provided data into the associated
.Sx RecordColumns
and
.Sx RecordData
variables.
Please note that the
.Sx RecordColumns
array values are then used to look up the data contained in the
.Sx RecordData
associative array to build the data record entry.
.Pp
Note: If the
.Ar <data_associative_array_name>
is provided, the file ID option must also be provided.
The
.Ar <column_array_name>
is always optional and, if not provided, the data contained in the
.Sx RecordColumns
array variable will be used.
.Ss RecordOpen
The following command opens a CSV file, locks it, and associates a file ID with
the file:
.Bd -ragged -offset 4n
.Sy RecordOpen
.Op Fl 1 Fl 2 Fl 3 Fl 4 Fl 5 Fl 6 Fl 7 Fl 8 Fl 9 Fl a Fl b Fl c
.Op Fl B Ar <path>
.Ar <file_path> ...
.Ed
.Pp
The command options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -offset 4n -width 4n
.It Fl 1 Fl 2 Fl 3 Fl 4 Fl 5 Fl 6 Fl 7 Fl 8 Fl 9
The numeric options
.Fl 1
through
.Fl 9
provide a shorthand to associate a file ID with a file path.
.It Fl a
Open the file, and append after any existing data. (This is the default.)
.It Fl b
Backup the
.Ar <file_path>
file to a bzipped file in the same directory with the same filename and with a
".0.bz2" extension (e.g.: <file_path>.0.bz2).
.It Fl B Ar <path>
Backup the
.Ar <file_path>
file to a bzipped file located at
.Ar <path> .
.Pp
If
.Ar <path>
is a directory, then the backup file will have the same filename with a ".0.bz2"
extension (e.g.: <file_path>.0.bz2) and will be located in the
.Ar <path>
directory.
Additional backup copies, up to LIBUI_BACKUPS copies (default of 10), will also
be kept with each successive version incrementally numbered starting with 1.
.Pp
If
.Ar <path>
is not a directory, then the backup file will have the
.Ar <path>
filename with a ".0.bz2" extension (e.g.: <path>.0.bz2) and will be located in
the same directory as the
.Ar <file_path>
file.
.It Fl c
Open the file, removing any existing data.
.El
.Pp
Opens the
.Ar <file_path>
file (creating it if necessary), locks the file, and associates the
.Ar <file_path>
with a file ID.
Any file opened using the
.Sy RecordOpen
command should be closed using the
.Sx RecordClose
command.
.Pp
If no file ID is provided, the next file ID is allocated starting with 1.
The file ID is incremented each time
.Sy RecordOpen
is called.
The file ID can be used as an option flag with the
.Sx RecordEntry
command or the
.Sx RecordClose
command.
See the
.Sx RecordEntry
command or the
.Sx RecordClose
command above fore more information.
.Pp
Important: the user must track calls to the
.Sy RecordOpen
command in order to know the associated file ID.
There is a limit of 9 open files.
If the
.Fl a
(Append) option flag is provided, writes to the file will be appended after any
existing data.
This is the default operation.
If the
.Fl c
(Create) option flag is provided, the file is created, i.e., any existing data
is erased.
.Pp
Note: The
.Sy RecordOpen
command passes parameters to and uses the
.Xr libui.sh 3
.Sy Open
command.
See the
.Sy Open
command in the
.Xr libui.sh 3
man page for more information.
.Sh VARIABLES
The
.Nm
.Xr libui.sh 3
mod
uses the
.Sx ${RecordColumns}
array variable and the
.Sx ${RecordData}
associative array variable to manage and exchange column and data values,
respectively.
.Sh EXAMPLES
This example uses the
.Nm
mod provided
.Sx RecordColumns
and
.Sx RecordData
variables:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
RecordColumns=( one two three four five )
RecordData[one]="Test 1"
RecordData[two]="Second"
RecordData[three]="$3,333.33"
RecordData[four]="\"Test four.\""
RecordData[five]="I said, \"five!\""
.Sy RecordOpen Ar '/var/records.csv'
.Sy RecordEntry
.Sy RecordClose
.Ed
.Pp
This will write a record containing:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
Test 1,Second,"$3,333.33","""Test four.""","I said, ""five!"""
.Ed
.Pp
to the file
.Ar /var/records.csv .
.Pp
This example uses user provided columns array (colarray) and data associative
array (data) variables:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
declare -a colarray
declare -A data
colarray=( one two three four five )
data[one]="Test 1"
data[two]="Second"
data[three]="$3,333.33"
data[four]="\"Test four.\""
data[five]="He said, \"five!\""
.Sy RecordOpen Fl 1 Ar '/var/records.csv'
.Sy RecordEntry Fl 1 Ar colarray Ar data
.Sy RecordClose Fl 1
.Ed
.Pp
This will write a record containing:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
Test 1,Second,"$3,333.33","""Test four.""","He said, ""five!"""
.Ed
.Pp
to the file
.Ar /var/records.csv .

.Sh NOTES
The
.Nm
.Xr libui.sh 3
mod maps the record file IDs to file descriptors 21 through 29.
.Pp
The
.Nm
.Xr libui.sh 3
mod uses associative arrays.
If the Bash shell is used, it must support associative arrays (i.e. bash v4+).
