.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
.Xr libui.sh 3
mod provides functions for creating and listing the contents of self-extracting
packages.
The self-extracting packages can be tar, shar, or star based.
.Pp
Note: The use of the tar format package is recommended.
The shar format is provided in case the package content must be sent over a
non-binary transport, or requires high portability.
The star format is provided in case the package content must be reviewed by a
human (e.g., transfer in or out of a classified environment).
.Pp
The
.Nm
.Xr libui.sh 3
mod provides the following commands:
.Ss CreatePackage
The CreatePackage command creates a package containing the files in the
specified
.Ar <source_directory>
directory.
.Pp
.Sy CreatePackage Oo Fl l Fl N Fl P Fl S Fl T Fl X Oc Oo Fl c Ar <compression> Oc Oo Fl d Ar <description> Oc Oo Fl f Ar <filelist_array_var_name> Oc Oo Fl h Ar <header_command> Oc Oo Fl i Ar <installer> Oc Oo Fl I Ar <installer_prep> Oc Oo Fl n Ar <encoding> Oc Oo Fl s Ar <source_directory> Oc Oo Fl x Ar <exclude_array_var_name> Oc Ar <package_filename>
.Pp
When executed, the
.Sy CreatePackage
command, will create a self-extracting package containing the files in the
specified
.Ar <source_directory>
directory.
.Pp
The available options are:
.Bl -tag -offset 4n -width 4n
.It Fl c
Compression
.Pp
The compression option to be provided to the archive command.
.Pp
Note: Typically, the tar archive command supports compression options.
These are typically
.Fl j
(bzip2) and
.Fl z
(gzip).
No compression option is used by default.
See
.Xr tar 1
for more information.

.It Fl h Ar <header_command>
Header
.Pp
Execute the function or command named
.Ar <header_command>
to generate the package header.
A default header function,
.Sx _CreatePackageHeader ,

.Pp
If a header command is provided using the
.Fl h
(Header) option, the respective header command must write the header into the

This will perform the above bullet list activities and execute the installer
script with the
.Fl h
command line option, e.g.:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
.Sy {environment spec} sh Ar <installer> Fl h
.Ed
.Pp
Note: The package header will extract the entire archive into the temporary
subdirectory.
The installer script should move the files from the temporary subdirectory to
their final destination.

.Bd -literal -offset 4n
.Sy \e${d}/path/to/installer \e${@} "\e${a}"
.Ed
.Pp
Where
.Sy \e${d}
will be replaced with with the temporary directory path,
.Sy path/to/installer
is the path to the installer in the extracted directory,
.Sy \e${@}
will be replaced with any user-provided option flags, and
