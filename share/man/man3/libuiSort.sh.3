.Sh NAME
.Nm libuiSort.sh
.Nd Sort Utilities Mod for the
.Xr libui.sh 3
user interface library
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Sy LoadMod Sort
.Pp
.Sy Sort
.Op Fl a Fl A Fl l Fl L Fl n Fl N Fl p Fl u
.Op Fl c Ar <compare_function>
.Ar <array_variable_name> ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
libui.sh mod provides a function for sorting a list contained in an array
variable.
.Pp
The
.Nm
.Xr libui.sh 3
mod provides the following commands:
.Ss Sort
The Sort command sorts the elements in the named array variable.
It supports sorts using a variety of lexicographical algorithms.
.Pp
.Sy Sort
.Op Fl a Fl A Fl l Fl L Fl n Fl N Fl p Fl u
.Op Fl c Ar <compare_function>
.Ar <array_variable_name> ...
.Pp
The command options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -offset 4n -width 4n
.It Fl a
Performs an ASCII ascending sort.
.It Fl A
Performs an ASCII descending sort.
.It Fl c Ar <compare_function_name>
Use the
.Ar <compare_function_name>
shell function to define order within the sort.
.Pp
The
.Ar <compare_function_name>
shell function must take two arguments (i.e. ${1} and ${2}) and return 0 (true)
when ${1} is less than ${2}.
.It Fl l
Performs a lexicographically ascending sort and is the default sort.
.It Fl L
Performs a lexicographically descending sort.
.It Fl n
Performs a numeric ascending sort.
.It Fl N
Performs a numeric descending sort.
.It Fl p
Performs a path depth first sort that sorts deeper paths above shorter paths.
.Pp
The
.Fl p
option is used by the
.Sy RemoveFileList
recursion to delete nested paths.
.It Fl u
Only keep unique values.
Removes any duplicate values from the array.
.It Ar <array_variable_name>
The name of the array variable that contains the list to be sorted.
.El
.Pp
Performs a simple sort of the values contained within the
.Ar <array_variable_name>
array variable.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Some examples include:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
.Sy Sort Ar list
.Ed
.Pp
Result: Sorts the
.Ar list
array (using the default ascending ASCII sort).
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
.Sy Sort Fl n Ar list
.Ed
.Pp
Result: Sorts the
.Ar list
array (using an ascending numeric sort).

.Fl p
option is used by the
