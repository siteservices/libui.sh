.Sy splitchecksum
.Op Fl h Fl H
.Op Fl s Ar <split_size>
.Op Fl X Ar <option>
.Ar <file> ...

Also provides a CRC32 checksum for the entire file.
If multiple files are provided, each file is separately split and displayed in a
separate block.

Example output:
.Bd -literal

.Ed
.Pp
The
.Nm
script can be executed using the following:
.Bd -ragged -offset 4n
.Sy splitchecksum
.Op Fl l Fl h Fl H
.Op Fl s Ar <split_size>
.Op Fl X Ar <option>
.Ar <file> ...
.Ed
.Pp
Available command line options are:
.Bl -tag -offset 4n -width 4n
.It Fl s Ar <split_size>
Split Size
.Pp
Specify the size (number of lines) of each split.
The default is 100 lines.
.It Ar <file>
The name of the file(s) to be processed.
.El
.Ss STANDARD OPTIONS
This script was built using the
.Xr libui.sh 3
user interface library.
Standard command line options provided by the
.Xr libui.sh 3
library are:
.Fl h
or
.Fl H
(Help) and
.Fl X Ar <option>
(XOption).
XOptions include Confirm, Force, NoAction, Overwrite, Quiet, Version, and Yes.
They are enabled using the first letter of the option (lower or upper case) as
.Ar <option> .
Please see
.Xr libui.sh 3
for more information.
.Pp
Note: Option value defaults can be obtained by executing with the
.Fl h
or
.Fl H
(Help) option.
.Sh FILES
The script creates a temporary directory (via GetTmp) where the splits are
saved.
The temporary directory should be removed upon exit.
Certain circumstances (e.g. some crashes) may prevent the cleanup handler from
being executed leaving the temporary directory in place.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Some example uses include:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
.Sy splitchecksum path/to/file
.Ed
.Pp
This splits path/to/file into one block and provides the checksum and a whole
file checksum.
Note: The checksums will be the same.
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
.Sy splitchecksum \-s 100 path/to/file
.Ed
.Pp
This splits path/to/file into block of 100 lines each and provides the checksum
for each split and a whole file checksum.
