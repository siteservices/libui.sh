.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Sy updatevimpackages
.Op Fl s Fl h Fl H
.Op Fl b Ar <branch>
.Op Fl X Ar <option>
.Op Ar <WORKSPACE>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Used to update relevant git repositories in the WORKSPACE directory and
update the vim package files in the .vim directory.
The script searches for the vim packages in the .vim directory and then attempts
to perform a git pull on the same directories in the WORKSPACE directory.
.Pp
The
.Nm
script can be executed using the following:
.Bd -ragged -offset 4n
.Sy updatevimpackages
.Op Fl s Fl v Fl h Fl H
.Op Fl b Ar <branch>
.Op Fl X Ar <option>
.Op Ar <WORKSPACE>
.Ed

Available command line options are:
.Bl -tag -offset 4n -width 4n
.It Fl s
Status
.Pp
Display repo status.
.It Ar <WORKSPACE>
The workspace directory.
.Pp
The WORKSPACE directory needs to be the path above the git repositories.
If
.Ar <WORKSPACE>
is not provided, the path provided in the
.Ev WORKSPACE
environment variable will be used.
If the
.Ev WORKSPACE
environment variable is not defined, the ~/.config/workspace file will be
sourced (to define
.Ev WORKSPACE Ns ).
If the ~/.config/workspace file does not exist, the current working directory
will be used.
.El
.Ss STANDARD OPTIONS
This script was built using the
.Xr libui.sh 3
user interface library.
Standard command line options provided by the
.Xr libui.sh 3
library are:
.Fl h
or
.Fl H
(Help) and
.Fl X Ar <option>
(XOption).
XOptions include Confirm, Force, NoAction, Overwrite, Quiet, Version, and Yes.
They are enabled using the first letter of the option (lower or upper case) as
.Ar <option> .
Please see
.Xr libui.sh 3
for more information.
.Pp
Note: Option value defaults can be obtained by executing with the
.Fl h
or
.Fl H
(Help) option.
.Sh FILES
The ~/.config/workspace file is sourced if the
.Ev WORKSPACE
variable is not defined.
.Pp
The script searches for the vim packages in the .vim directory and then attempts
to perform a git pull on the same directories in the WORKSPACE directory.
.Pp
The script creates a temporary directory (via GetTmp) that should be removed
upon exit.
Certain circumstances (e.g. some crashes) may prevent the cleanup handler from
being executed leaving the temporary directory in place.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Some example uses include:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
.Sy updatevimpackages

repositories in the WORKSPACE directory after performing a git pull on each.
