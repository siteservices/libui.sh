# libui User Interface Library Regression Test Suite

## Description

The libui user interface library provides a script execution environment that
simplifies development of robust scripts with a consistent user interface. This
regression test suite provides a number of tests that can be executed to verify
operation after introducting new changes or when executing within a new system
environment.

The easiest way to start execute the test suite is to use the `libui -t`
command. Use `man libui` for more details.
